##**HOW TO RUN**

####**Download Content**
- Download both files of this page 
- Dowload Python 3.7.8
- Download an IDE of your choice, would recommend VsCode
- run 'pip install discord.py'

- Go over to the discord developer portal
- Create a bot
- Get the token for the bot (will be used later, DO NOT SHARE WITH FRIENDS)
- Invite it to the discord server
step by step from this yt video

####**Finalising code**
- Paste your bot token within the '' of the client.run('add your token here') line
- Copy the correct path by right clicking the file and clicking 'copy path' for the flooded.txt file 
- Then run the file in your IDE
      


##**Discord commands**
- .octo to flood by creating new channels
- .delete to delete all channels in the server (probably should be first)


##**HOW TO HANDLE ERRORS**
- Make sure you have Python 3.7.8 installed
- Make sure discord.py is installed (Google how to install python packets)
- If all of the above have been tested download the oldest release, which will work 100% of the time
